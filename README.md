This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: forgetting to handle the base case correctly.  The factorial function is implemented recursively, but it does not check for negative input values, which leads to infinite recursion and a RecursionError. The solution shows how to modify the function to handle negative inputs gracefully.
